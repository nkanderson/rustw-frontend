# rustw-frontend

This is a redesign of the frontend of [rustw](https://github.com/nrc/rustw), a web frontend for the Rust compiler.

## Running the project

To run the json-server (the mocked backend):
`npm run start:api`

To run the webpack dev server (for the frontend):
`npm run start:app`

Adding a trivial change for testing.
